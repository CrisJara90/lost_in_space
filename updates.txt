My update:

    - Create a welcome screen. This is going to be the first thing you will see when opening the game.
      The screen will say "Welcome to Lost in Space!" and play some music. Or maybe just "Lost in Space".
      There should be an option to disable the music (it can be a button with the sound simbol that when click
      disables the music and changes to the not music simbol). This screen should also let you choose with what
      kind of ship you want to play.

    - Change the border constant to be of a size that lets no spaces between the border and the ship. 
      I want the ship to always move the scren. In the current implementation the ship moves the screen only when
      reaches certain part. change that.

    - Put a help option or something to guide the user in how the game works, the features and the 
      allowed movements.

1.- Put the player in the center of the screen. (DONE)

2.- fix the changing ship feature. The second ship doesn't show up when you press 2. (DONE)

3.- The player should be able to collect power-up objects through the game. To implement this new feature
    create a new library called power_up to manage the power_up related code. 
    
        The library should contain the following:
        
            - An enum to represent the different power-ups within the code.

            - A function to convert a power_up enum value to an image. (the function should use a switch and return
              a bitmap, for example -> case SHIELD: return bitmap_named("shield");)

            - Create a struct in the header file (power_up.h) to represent a power_up object with properties type,
              to indicate the kind of power_up it is, and sprite, for their visual representation.

            - A function to initialize a power_up (should be called "new_power_up")

                To implement this function follow the tasksheet page 3 step 3.

            - A procedure draw_power_up

                To implement this function follow the tasksheet page 3 step 3.

            - A function update_power_up

                To implement this function follow the tasksheet page 3 step 3.

    Add a power-up into main. Draw it near the player instead of the white rectangle.

                To implement this follow the tasksheet page 3 step 3.

4.- Improve the HUD (heads up display)

        - Create a procedure to draw this, in the program.cpp file.

        - The HUD should display the following:

            - Location of the player

            - Score of the player
            
            - A fuel gauge -using one of the bars from resources.

            - Add at least two other features yourself. Think of something that links to your selected power ups.

5.- Add a fuel_pct field to the player struct, and initialize it to 0.75 when the player is created.
